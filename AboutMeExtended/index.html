     <li>Dune</li>
<p>Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. 
    It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. 
    While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice",
     a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a 
     kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis,
      control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics,
       religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the
        control of Arrakis and its spice.</p>

    <li>Blade Runner 2049</li>
<p>In the year 2049, bio-engineered humans called replicants have been integrated into society, 
    though still face discrimination from humans. Officer K, a Nexus-9 replicant model, works as a Blade Runner for the
     Los Angeles Police Department, hunting down and retiring outdated Nexus-8 model replicants with open-ended lifespans rushed 
     into production by the Tyrell Corporation in 2020 following the death of its founder, Dr. Eldon Tyrell, in November 2019. 
     K lives with his Wallace designed and produced "Joi", who keeps him company in his apartment as a holographic projection.</p>
